# RBXport
A tool for converting Roblox place files to local files on your computer.

Make sure you have Lua or LuaJIT (recommended) installed, and run `lua RBXport`. It will tell you what to do.

Will create a project that can be synced by [Osyris' RbxRefresh](https://github.com/osyrisrblx/RbxRefresh).
